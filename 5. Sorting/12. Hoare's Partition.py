Question:
    a Python function to perform Hoare's partitioning.
    Hoareâ€™s partition chooses the first element as pivot and partitions the array so that:
    - All elements <= pivot are on the left side.
    - All elWriteements >= pivot are on the right side.
"""
"""
Input:
    A list of integers, and two integers: low (start index) and high (end index).
Output:
    The partition index (final position of pivot may not be exact).
